  <h2>Summary</h2>
  
  <p>
    A ticking-time-bomb insomniac and a slippery soap salesman channel primal male aggression into a shocking new form of therapy. Their concept catches on, with underground "fight clubs" forming in every town, until an eccentric gets in the way and ignites an out-of-control spiral toward oblivion.

  <h3>Katie says...</h3>
  <p>Best Movie Ever! This is not like any Marvel film we have seen. It's incredible. The visuals in this film are literally out of this world. The comedy is spot on and Chris Pratt is hilarious! Nothing like it. Ever. I'm positive I'm going to see this movie again.</p>

  <h3>Brian says...</h3>
  <p>Meh.</p>
